## Description
Founded on December 1st 2000 JP Morgan is a multinational financial services company and investment bank and is ranked by the S&P as the largest bank in the US with **$2.988 trillion AUM** and employing over 256,000 people. The firm is headed by CEO Jamie Dimon who once said that any *employee of his firm caught trading bitcoin would be fired*.

Despite Jasmie Dimon previous denouncement of bitcoin, the bank was the first to announce the ability to send instant payments to other instutional customers using blockchain tech including the use a new coin called JPM Coin. 

Mechanics of the coin and more infromation on how it works can be found in the [news announcement](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments).


### Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space?
1. The U.S.'s first major bank to create their own coin
2. Their creation looks forward to a payment solution where settlement can be finished at the same time as when the smart contract closes. This, thus, reduces the settle time needed.

What are their strengths and weaknesses?
1. Strengths: They are the pioneer + the very first one to do it
2. Weakness: They haven't been legally approved by the regulators + public use can raise great questions regarding privacy and its effects on the dollar value


### What is the prognosis for this company?
The creation is believed to both hold multiple opportunities for growth and face different potential risks introducing it to the public or putting it into real practice.

Where do they expect to be in the future?

They want to be both the pioneer and a giant in the disruption of FinTech by trying out "everything they can to transform themselves first" and even by paving the way out for the legalization of cryptocurrencies.
